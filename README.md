### Description 
A small application in progress that determines the allergens of a user-inputted food 

## Use of AI 
This application was coded in assistance with ChatGPT. I had a previous version that worked perfectly several years ago before OpenAI changed their API completely. It already interfaces poorly with Swift, but the API is community build unless you fetch URL directly, which is what this new version does. I know what each line does, and I know how this project works. I simply did not want to deal with leanring a new method to interface with ChatGPT. 

## Note The API key is not in the file. 
Email me at francesco.c.severino.27@dartmouth.edu if you want to use my API token. I will share it with you. I am aware this is horrible practice. I know API keys are not supposed to be hardcoded. I just want to share this idea for the DALI application, as previously it was a personal project. Either you can use your own key (it's not expensive if you already are using OpenAI as a dev, otherwise it's $10 minimum), or I will be happy to share mine for the purpose of testing this project.
